This is a simple command line based betting game implemented using Node.js. 
The player starts off with a bankroll of $100 and bets money to guess a number randomly chosen by the game. If the player loses all their money, the game ends.
The game should ask the player to place a bet between $5 and $10, then to guess a number between 1 and 10.
